## 📊 Example: How It Works

**Scenario**: You create a task "Integrate Third-Party Payment API"

**Step 1: Click Assess Risk**
- AI analyzes task details
- Considers complexity and dependencies

**Step 2: AI Analysis Results**
```
Likelihood: 3/3 (High)
  "External API dependency, potential breaking changes"
  
Impact: 3/3 (High)
  "Payment failures directly affect revenue"
  
Risk Score: 9/9
Risk Level: CRITICAL

Key Factors:
  • External dependency
  • PCI compliance requirements
  • Rollback complexity
  • Customer impact
```

**Step 3: Risk Badge Appears**
- Red indicator on task: "Risk: Critical (9/9)"
- Visible to all team members
- Indicates urgency

**Step 4: Get Mitigation Strategies**
```
1. MITIGATE: Comprehensive Testing (75% effectiveness)
   - Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
   - Timeline: 1-2 weeks
   
2. TRANSFER: Use Payment Gateway Middleware (90% effectiveness)
   - Use established service (Stripe, PayPal)
   - Timeline: 1 week
   
3. AVOID: Delay Implementation (100% effectiveness)
   - Wait for API stability
   - Timeline: Depends on vendor
   
4. ACCEPT: Create Rollback Plan (40% effectiveness)
   - Prepare quick restore procedure
   - Timeline: Ongoing
```

**Step 5: Team Takes Action**
- Implements suggested mitigations
- Tracks identified indicators
- Monitors progress
- Updates risk assessment
