## Files Changed

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Start application
- [ ] Log in as User A
- [ ] Create chat room with User B
- [ ] Log in as User B (different window)
- [ ] Send message as User B
- [ ] Switch to User A - badge should show [1]
- [ ] Click Messages - view the chat room
- [ ] Return to dashboard - badge should disappear

## API Endpoint
```
GET /messages/messages/unread-count/
Response: {"unread_count": 5}
```

## How to Test Manually
```javascript
// In browser console (F12):
fetch('/messages/messages/unread-count/')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log(d))
```

## Configuration
### Refresh Interval (in `base.html`)
Change `30000` to desired milliseconds:
```javascript
setInterval(updateUnreadMessageCount, 30000);
```

### Time Window (in `messaging/views.py`)
Change `24` to desired hours:
```python
recent_cutoff = timezone.now() - timedelta(hours=24)
```

## Troubleshooting
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Badge not showing | Clear cache (Ctrl+F5), check console for errors |
| Wrong count | Verify user is member of room, ensure messages exist |
| Not updating | Wait 30 seconds, check Network tab for API calls |
| JavaScript error | Check browser console (F12), verify JS not blocked |
