# Quick Test Guide - AI Assistant Aggregate Query Fix

## 🎯 What Was Fixed?

The AI Assistant can now answer system-wide questions like:
- ✅ "How many total tasks are in all the boards?"
- ✅ "Total tasks across all projects?"
- ✅ "How many tasks by status?"

---

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Ensure Server is Running
```powershell
cd c:\Users\Avishek Paul\TaskFlow

# If server is not running:
python manage.py runserver
```

### Step 2: Open Chat Interface
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:8000/assistant/chat/
2. Make sure you're logged in as admin

### Step 3: Ask the Original Question
**Copy and paste this:**
```
How many total tasks are in all the boards?
```

### Expected Results (After Fix)

You should get a response similar to:

```
Based on my analysis of all your projects, here's the complete overview:

**System-Wide Task Analytics**

Total Tasks: 47
Total Boards: 5

**Tasks by Status:**
- Todo: 18
- In Progress: 14
- Done: 15

**Tasks by Board:**
- Board 1: 1
- Software Project: 22
- My Tasks Demo Board: 8
- Social Media Relaunch for 'Nova' Sportswear: 4
- Bug Tracking: 12

This shows you have 47 tasks distributed across 5 boards...
