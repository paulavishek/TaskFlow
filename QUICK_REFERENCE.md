## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Q: I don't see the new sections on task detail page**
- A: Make sure you're viewing a task (not just the board view)
- A: Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5) and reload
- A: Check browser console for errors (F12)

**Q: The sections show but no data inside**
- A: Run: `python manage.py populate_test_data` again
- A: Check database has data: `python verify_demo_data.py`

**Q: Template syntax looks wrong**
- A: All templates use Django template syntax ({% if %}, {% for %}, etc.)
- A: Bootstrap classes ensure proper styling

**Q: I want to see all the demo data code**
- A: Check: `kanban/management/commands/populate_test_data.py` (445+ new lines)
