## Database Schema

### FileAttachment Table
```
ID | chat_room_id | uploaded_by_id | file | filename | file_size | file_type | description | uploaded_at | deleted_at | created_at | updated_at
```

### TaskFile Table
```
ID | task_id | uploaded_by_id | file | filename | file_size | file_type | description | uploaded_at | deleted_at | created_at | updated_at
```

## Migrations

### Applied Migrations
- `messaging/migrations/0002_fileattachment.py` - Created FileAttachment model
- `kanban/migrations/0027_taskfile.py` - Created TaskFile model

## Security Features

### Permission Checks
1. **Chat Room Files:**
   - Only room members can view/download files
   - Only file owner, room creator, or staff can delete
   - Room member check enforced on upload

2. **Task Files:**
   - Only board members can view/download files
   - Only file owner or staff can delete
   - Board member check enforced on upload

### File Handling
- Files stored in `media/chat_rooms/` and `media/tasks/` with date-based organization
- Soft delete preserves audit trail
- File type validation prevents malicious uploads
- File size validation prevents storage issues

## Usage Examples

### For Users

#### Uploading a File to a Chat Room
1. Open a chat room
2. Click the "Attach file" button (paperclip icon)
3. Select a file from your computer
4. Optionally add a description
5. Click "Upload"
6. File appears in the Files sidebar

#### Uploading a File to a Task
1. Open a task detail page
2. Click the "Upload" button in the Attachments card
3. Select a file from your computer
4. Optionally add a description
5. Click "Upload"
6. File appears in the Attachments list

#### Downloading a File
1. Click on the filename link in the file list
2. File downloads to your computer

#### Deleting a File
1. Click the trash icon next to the file
2. Confirm deletion
3. File is soft-deleted (marked as deleted but record kept)

### For Developers

#### Accessing Files in Templates
```django
{% for file in chat_room.file_attachments.all %}
    {% if not file.is_deleted %}
        <a href="{% url 'messaging:download_chat_room_file' file_id=file.id %}">
            {{ file.filename }}
        </a>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```

#### Getting File Icon
```python
icon_class = file.get_file_icon()  # Returns 'fa-file-pdf', 'fa-file-word', etc.
```

#### Checking if File is Deleted
```python
if file.is_deleted():
    print(f"File {file.filename} was deleted on {file.deleted_at}")
```

#### Validating File Type
```python
if TaskFile.is_valid_file_type('document.pdf'):
    print("Valid file type")
else:
    print("Invalid file type")
```

## Storage Configuration

### Settings (`kanban_board/settings.py`)
```python
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
```

### Upload Directory Structure
```
media/
├── chat_rooms/
│   └── YYYY/MM/DD/
│       └── uploaded_files...
└── tasks/
    └── YYYY/MM/DD/
        └── uploaded_files...
```

## Testing File Management

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Upload valid file to chat room
- [ ] Upload oversized file (should show error)
- [ ] Upload invalid file type (should show error)
- [ ] Download file from chat room
- [ ] Delete file from chat room (soft delete)
- [ ] Upload valid file to task
- [ ] Download file from task
- [ ] Delete file from task
- [ ] Verify permission checks (non-members can't access)
- [ ] Verify file list displays correctly
- [ ] Test file icons display correctly

### Unit Tests
Test coverage should include:
- File upload with valid files
- File upload validation (size, type)
- File download with proper permissions
- File deletion (soft delete)
- File permission checks
- JSON API responses

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries
- File lists are optimized with `values()` queries
- Soft delete filters exclude deleted files by default
- Consider pagination for large file lists

### Storage
- Files organized by date to prevent directory bloat
- Consider implementing periodic cleanup of old files
- Monitor storage usage for 10MB+ file uploads

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **File Preview:** Add inline preview for images and PDFs
2. **Bulk Upload:** Support uploading multiple files at once
3. **File Search:** Search files by name/content
4. **Version Control:** Track file updates/versions
5. **Virus Scanning:** Integrate antivirus scanning
6. **File Expiration:** Auto-delete files after X days
7. **Storage Quotas:** Limit storage per chat room/task
8. **File Sharing:** Share files outside the platform

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** File upload returns 403 Forbidden
- **Solution:** Ensure user is a member of the chat room/board

**Issue:** File download returns 404
- **Solution:** Check that file exists and is not deleted

**Issue:** Upload button not appearing
- **Solution:** Verify file permissions (check `form.is_valid()` in view)

**Issue:** File list empty despite uploaded files
- **Solution:** Files may be soft-deleted; check `deleted_at` field
