# AI Assistant - Capabilities Summary

## Overview

Your TaskFlow AI Assistant is a conversational AI that helps with project management. Here's what it can and cannot do.

---

## ✅ What It CAN Answer

### Category 1: Aggregate/System-Wide Queries (NEWLY FIXED)
These now work after today's fix:

```
"How many total tasks are in all the boards?"
"Total tasks across all projects?"
"How many tasks do I have?"
"Count all tasks"
"What's the total task count?"
"How many tasks by status?"
"Which board has the most tasks?"
"Show me task distribution across boards"
```

**Response includes:** Total count, breakdown by status, breakdown by board

---

### Category 2: Single-Board Queries (ALWAYS WORKED)
```
"How many tasks in the Software Project?"
"What's the status of Board 1?"
"Who is assigned to tasks in the Bug Tracking board?"
"Show me tasks in [board name]"
"What's blocking the X project?"
"List all tasks in this board"
```

**Response includes:** Task details, status, assignees, priority

---

### Category 3: General Project Advice (ALWAYS WORKED)
```
"What are best practices for project management?"
"How should I manage my team's workload?"
"What's a good agile methodology?"
"How do I prioritize tasks?"
"Best practices for risk management?"
"What are the benefits of kanban?"
```

**Response includes:** Best practices, methodologies, recommendations

---

### Category 4: Web Search Results (ALWAYS WORKED - if enabled)
```
"Latest project management trends"
"What are the best tools for team collaboration?"
"Industry best practices for agile development"
"Recent updates in project management"
"What's new in productivity tools?"
```

**Response includes:** Web results, sources, current information

---

## ❌ What It CANNOT Answer (Design Limitations)

### Category 1: Cross-Board Comparisons
```
❌ "Compare task counts across boards"
❌ "Which board is most behind schedule?"
❌ "Rank boards by completion percentage"
```

**Why:** Requires sorting/ranking logic beyond AI's training data

**Workaround:** Ask about each board individually, then compare manually

---

### Category 2: Predictive Analytics
```
❌ "When will we finish all tasks?"
❌ "What's the estimated completion date?"
❌ "How fast is our team working?"
❌ "Will we meet the deadline?"
```

**Why:** Requires historical trend data not available in context

**Workaround:** Provide past data or velocity metrics, then ask

---

### Category 3: Real-Time Notifications
```
❌ "Alert me when a task is overdue"
❌ "Notify me if a team member is overloaded"
❌ "Send me daily summaries"
```

**Why:** AI Assistant is conversational, not event-driven

**Workaround:** Use TaskFlow's notification system directly

---

### Category 4: Complex Business Logic
```
❌ "Automatically assign tasks to team members"
❌ "Create a project schedule"
❌ "Move all overdue tasks to urgent"
```

**Why:** Requires executing actions, not just providing information

**Workaround:** Manual execution or Django admin

---

### Category 5: Sensitive/Private Data Beyond Project Scope
```
❌ "Show me employee salaries"
❌ "Who should I fire?"
❌ "Confidential company information"
```

**Why:** Not available in TaskFlow database

## 🎯 Capability Matrix

| Question Type | Status | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **System-wide counts** | ✅ Works | "Total tasks?" | Fixed today |
| **Single board** | ✅ Works | "Tasks in Board X?" | Original feature |
| **Status breakdown** | ✅ Works | "How many completed?" | With board context |
| **Team workload** | ✅ Works | "Who has most tasks?" | Single board only |
| **Best practices** | ✅ Works | "Agile best practices?" | General knowledge |
| **Web search** | ✅ Works | "Latest trends?" | If enabled |
| **Comparisons** | ⚠️ Limited | "Which board is busiest?" | Can describe, not rank |
| **Predictions** | ❌ Doesn't | "When will we finish?" | Not implemented |
| **Notifications** | ❌ Doesn't | "Alert me if..." | Different system |
| **Actions** | ❌ Doesn't | "Create a project" | Read-only mode |

## 💡 Smart Workarounds

### For Predictions
```
Problem: "When will we finish?"
Solution: "Based on current progress, we have 47 tasks with 
          18 done (38%). If you're doing 5/week, that's 6 weeks."
```

### For Comparisons
```
Problem: "Which board is behind?"
Workaround:
  Ask: "How many tasks in Board 1?"
  Ask: "How many tasks in Board 2?"
  Ask: "Compare these numbers"
```

### For Detailed Analytics
```
Problem: "What's our velocity?"
Solution: Provide historical data
  Ask: "We completed 50 tasks last month, 30 this month. 
        What does this mean for timelines?"
```

## 🎓 Best Practices for Getting Good Answers

### Do This ✅
```
Good: "How many tasks are currently in progress across all boards?"
Why: Clear, specific, aggregate keyword present

Good: "What's the status of the Software Project?"
Why: Specific board named

Good: "I have 10 tasks assigned, 3 are overdue. What should I prioritize?"
Why: Provides context for better advice

Good: "Show me completed tasks in Board X"
Why: Clear scope and action
```

### Don't Do This ❌
```
Bad: "What should I do?"
Why: Too vague

Bad: "Tell me everything"
Why: Requests too much data

Bad: "Why is my team slow?"
Why: Requires judgment beyond data

Bad: "Make decisions for me"
Why: AI provides input, not decisions
```
