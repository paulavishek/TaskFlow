A fully functional Gantt chart with interactive features based on your friend's design plan.

## 🎯 Quick Access

1. **Go to any board** → Click the **"Gantt Chart"** button
2. **Direct URL**: `/boards/{board_id}/gantt/`

## 🚀 Getting Started (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Add Sample Data (Optional)
```powershell

4. Set **Progress** (0-100%)
5. Save the task

### Step 3: View the Gantt Chart

1. Click "Gantt Chart" button on your board
2. You'll see all tasks with dates displayed as horizontal bars
