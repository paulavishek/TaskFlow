---

### ⚠️ LIMITED CAPABILITIES (Use With Caveats)

#### 1. **Cross-Board Comparisons**
**What it can do (somewhat):**
- Compare two boards if asked directly
- Describe differences between boards
- Identify which board is busier

**What it CANNOT:**
- Rank all boards by multiple criteria
- Perform complex multi-factor analysis
- Optimize board prioritization

**Examples with limitations:**
```
✅ "Is Board A bigger than Board B?" → Works (direct comparison)
⚠️ "Rank boards by efficiency" → Partial (descriptive only, no ranking)
❌ "Which board should we prioritize?" → Vague (needs more context)
```

**Why Limited:** Requires sorting/ranking logic and business rules

---

#### 2. **Predictive Analytics**
**What it can do (basic):**
- Estimate completion based on current velocity
- Suggest timelines based on past data
- Estimate risk probability

**What it CANNOT:**
- Predict exact completion dates with accuracy
- Account for unknown factors
- Provide statistical confidence intervals
- Handle complex dependencies

**Examples with limitations:**
```
❌ "When will we finish all tasks?" → Cannot - needs historical data
⚠️ "If we have 10 tasks and complete 2 per week..." → Works if you provide data
❌ "Will we meet the deadline?" → Depends on many unknowns
```

**Why Limited:** Requires historical velocity data and statistical models

---

#### 3. **Priority Optimization**
**What it can do:**
- Suggest priorities based on data
- Recommend order of execution
- Identify critical path

**What it CANNOT:**
- Make definitive priority decisions
- Account for business factors outside data
- Handle complex trade-offs automatically

**Examples with limitations:**
```
⚠️ "What should I prioritize?" → Suggests based on data, but human judgment needed
✅ "Show me high-risk tasks first" → Works - can rank by risk
❌ "Automatically re-prioritize all tasks" → Cannot - needs human approval
```

**Why Limited:** Business priorities involve judgment calls beyond data

---

### ❌ NOT CAPABLE (Clear Limitations)

#### 1. **Action Execution**
**Cannot do:**
- Create/modify/delete tasks
- Assign tasks to team members
- Move tasks between statuses
- Create projects or boards
- Close issues automatically
- Update task data

**Why:** AI is read-only; no write permissions by design

---

#### 2. **Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts**
**Cannot do:**
- Send notifications/alerts
- Monitor tasks continuously
- Trigger on specific events
- Create dashboard widgets
- Generate scheduled reports
- Set up auto-escalations

**Why:** Conversational interface, not event-driven system

---

#### 3. **Complex Business Logic**
**Cannot do:**
- Implement custom workflows
- Apply complex business rules
- Perform multi-step decisions
- Handle "if-then" logic chains
- Process conditional scenarios
- Apply domain-specific algorithms

**Why:** LLM lacks context for complex business logic

---

#### 4. **Sensitive/Private Information Beyond Project Scope**
**Cannot do:**
- Access employee salaries or HR data
- Retrieve confidential agreements
- Access financial information
- Retrieve audit logs
- See admin/system information
- Access data outside user's permissions

**Why:** Not available in database; security restriction

---

#### 5. **Real-Time Integrations**
**Cannot do:**
- Push changes to external systems
- Pull real-time data from APIs
- Update third-party tools automatically
- Sync with calendar/scheduling apps
- Integrate with version control
- Update status in linked systems

**Why:** Limited to TaskFlow data only

## Conclusion

**The honest answer to your question: YES**

You can safely claim that the AI assistant:
1. ✅ Can answer questions about boards and tasks
2. ✅ Can provide suggestions and advice

**With the important caveat:** It's a read-only, conversational AI that's excellent at information retrieval and advice, but cannot execute actions or provide real-time monitoring.

This is actually a **strong product**. The limitations are by design, not bugs. The key is being honest about what it can/cannot do in your marketing.

**Recommended tagline:**
> "Your AI Project Assistant - Get instant answers about your boards and tasks, plus smart recommendations to improve your workflow."

This is 100% true and highlights the genuine strengths of the system.
