## Query Routing Flow

The `get_response()` method uses intelligent routing:

```
User Query
    ↓
1. Check if Aggregate Query → _get_aggregate_context()
2. Check if Risk Query → _get_risk_context()
3. Check if Stakeholder Query → _get_stakeholder_context()
4. Check if Resource Query → _get_resource_context()
5. Check if Lean Query → _get_lean_context()
6. Check if Dependency Query → _get_dependency_context()
7. Check if Project Query → get_taskflow_context()
8. Add Knowledge Base Context
9. Add Web Search (if enabled)
    ↓
Build System Prompt with All Available Context
    ↓
Send to Gemini API
    ↓
Return Response with Context Metadata
```

### Error Handling

- Try-except blocks for each context builder
- Logging for debugging
- Empty string return if no relevant data found

### Organization Filtering

All context builders inherit organization filtering from `_get_user_boards()`:

```python
def _get_user_boards(self, organization=None):
    """Helper to get user's boards with optional organization filter"""
    try:
        if not organization:
            organization = self.user.profile.organization
    except:
        organization = None
    
    if organization:
        return Board.objects.filter(
            Q(organization=organization) & 
            (Q(created_by=self.user) | Q(members=self.user))
        ).distinct()
    else:
        return Board.objects.filter(
            Q(created_by=self.user) | Q(members=self.user)
        ).distinct()
```
