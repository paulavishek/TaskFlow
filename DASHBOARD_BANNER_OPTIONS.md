# Dashboard Banner Recommendations

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Situation**
The dashboard currently has a "New Feature: Lean Six Sigma Integration" banner that conflicts with our new Advanced Features organization approach.

## ðŸ’¡ **Three Options for the Dashboard Banner**

### **Option 1: Update to Advanced Features Banner (IMPLEMENTED)**
âœ… **What I just did:**
- Changed the banner to promote "Advanced AI Features"
- Highlights the new organization approach
- Points users to board settings for advanced tools
- Maintains awareness without redundancy

### **Option 2: Complete Removal**
```html
<!-- Remove the entire banner section for maximum cleanliness -->
```
**Pros:**
- Cleanest possible dashboard
- Consistent with decluttering approach
- Focuses on core metrics and tasks

**Cons:**
- Users might not discover advanced features
- Less promotional value for AI capabilities

### **Option 3: Dismissible Information Card**
```html
<!-- Add a dismissible card that remembers user preference -->
<div class="alert alert-info alert-dismissible fade show" id="advanced-features-info">
    <strong>ðŸ’¡ Tip:</strong> Access advanced AI features through any board's settings menu.
    <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="alert"></button>
</div>
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **My Recommendation**

I recommend **keeping the updated banner** (Option 1) for these reasons:

1. **Feature Discovery**: Helps users find the new Advanced Features organization
2. **Consistency**: Aligns with our decluttering goals while maintaining visibility
3. **Professional**: Shows the app is actively developed and organized
4. **Temporary**: Can be removed later once users are familiar with the new structure

## ðŸ”„ **Alternative: Make it Dismissible**

If you want maximum cleanliness, we could make the banner dismissible with local storage:

```javascript
// Add to dashboard
if (localStorage.getItem('advancedFeaturesBannerDismissed') !== 'true') {
    // Show banner
} else {
    // Hide banner
}
```

**What would you prefer?**
- Keep the updated Advanced Features banner
- Remove it completely for maximum cleanliness  
- Make it dismissible
- Something else?
