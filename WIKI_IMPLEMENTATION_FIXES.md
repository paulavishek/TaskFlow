# Wiki Implementation - Comprehensive Fixes

## Overview
Fixed multiple critical issues in the wiki implementation to ensure proper functionality. All fixes have been applied and verified.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **AttributeError: 'User' object has no attribute 'organizations'** ✅
**Problem:** Wiki views were trying to access `request.user.organizations.first()` which doesn't exist on the User model.

**Root Cause:** The relationship is `User` → `UserProfile` → `Organization`, not directly on User.

**Solution:** Updated all views to access organization through the user's profile:
```python
# Before (WRONG)
org = request.user.organizations.first()

# After (CORRECT)
org = request.user.profile.organization if hasattr(request.user, 'profile') else None
```

**Files Modified:**
- `wiki/views.py` - Updated 8 functions:
  - `WikiBaseView.get_organization()`
  - `wiki_search()`
  - `meeting_notes_list()`
  - `meeting_notes_create()`
  - `meeting_notes_detail()`
  - `quick_link_wiki()`
  - `wiki_page_history()`
  - `wiki_page_restore()`

### 2. **PermissionDenied Error - Incorrect Permission Check** ✅
**Problem:** `test_func()` was checking `self.request.user in org.members.all()` which failed because `org.members` is a RelatedManager for UserProfile objects, not User objects.

**Root Cause:** Mismatched types in membership check - comparing User to UserProfile.

**Solution:** Updated permission check to properly verify user's profile in organization:
```python
# Before (WRONG)
return org and self.request.user in org.members.all()

# After (CORRECT)
if not org:
    return False
return hasattr(self.request.user, 'profile') and self.request.user.profile.organization == org
```

**File Modified:**
- `wiki/views.py` - `WikiBaseView.test_func()`

---

### 3. **TemplateSyntaxError: Invalid filter 'add_class'** ✅
**Problem:** Templates were using the `add_class` filter (from django-widget-tweaks) without loading the required template tags.

**Root Cause:** Missing `{% load widget_tweaks %}` statement in templates.

**Solution:** Added `{% load widget_tweaks %}` to all templates that use form field rendering with `add_class` filter.

**Files Modified (4 templates):**
1. `templates/wiki/page_form.html`
2. `templates/wiki/meeting_notes_form.html`
3. `templates/wiki/link_form.html`
4. `templates/wiki/category_form.html`

**Change Applied:**
```html
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% load crispy_forms_tags %}
{% load widget_tweaks %}  <!-- ADDED -->
```

## How the User Organization System Works

```
User Model
    ↓
    (OneToOneField)
    ↓
UserProfile
    ↓
    (ForeignKey, related_name='members')
    ↓
Organization

Access Pattern:
user.profile.organization  ← Get user's organization
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Create New Wiki Page:**
   - Go to `/wiki/create/`
   - Should load form without TemplateSyntaxError
   - Should have proper permission checks

2. **Wiki Search:**
   - Go to `/wiki/search/`
   - Should display search results without AttributeError

3. **Meeting Notes:**
   - Go to `/wiki/meeting-notes/create/`
   - Should load form properly

4. **Permission Testing:**
   - Visit wiki pages with users from different organizations
   - Users should only see their organization's content

## Summary

All critical issues have been identified and fixed:
- ✅ User-Organization relationship corrected in views
- ✅ Permission checks fixed to use proper relationship
- ✅ Template tags properly loaded in all forms
- ✅ No syntax errors detected
- ✅ All configurations verified

**Wiki feature is now fully functional!**
