# Column Scroll Bar Positioning Fix

## Issue Identified
The scroll bar for some columns (particularly the "In Progress" column) was appearing outside the column boundaries instead of within the column container.

## Root Causes
1. **CSS Containment Issues**: The scroll bars were not properly contained within their parent column elements
2. **Conflicting Positioning Rules**: Multiple CSS rules were interfering with each other
3. **Overflow Management**: Parent containers had conflicting overflow settings
4. **Scroll Indicators Interference**: Custom scroll indicators were potentially affecting native scroll bar positioning

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. CSS Containment Fixes
- Added `position: relative` to `.kanban-column` to ensure proper containment
- Set `overflow: visible` on the kanban board to prevent interference
- Added CSS containment (`contain: layout`) to scrollable columns

### 2. Simplified Scrollable Column CSS
```css
.kanban-column-tasks.scrollable {
    /* Core scrolling properties */
    height: var(--column-scroll-max-height) !important;
    overflow-y: auto !important;
    overflow-x: hidden !important;
    
    /* Ensure proper containment within parent column */
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    
    /* Prevent layout shifts */
    contain: layout;
}
```

### 3. Column Wrapper Improvements
- Ensured `.kanban-column` has `position: relative` for proper containment
- Added `overflow: visible` to prevent cutting off scroll bars
- Removed conflicting transform and positioning rules

### 4. JavaScript Simplification
- Removed complex inline style overrides that were causing conflicts
- Simplified the `updateColumnScrolling()` function to apply only essential styles
- Temporarily disabled scroll indicators to isolate the core issue

### 5. Debug Tools Added
- Created `scroll-debug.css` with visual outlines to debug column boundaries
- Enhanced test page with detailed positioning information
- Added toggle functionality for debug outlines

## Key Changes Made

### JavaScript (kanban.js)
```javascript
// Simplified scrolling application
column.style.height = COLUMN_SCROLL_CONFIG.MAX_HEIGHT + 'px';
column.style.overflowY = 'auto';
column.style.overflowX = 'hidden';

// Ensure wrapper doesn't interfere
if (columnWrapper) {
    columnWrapper.style.position = 'relative';
    columnWrapper.style.overflow = 'visible';
}
```

### CSS (styles.css)
- Fixed `.kanban-column` positioning and containment
- Simplified `.kanban-column-tasks.scrollable` rules
- Added proper box-sizing and width constraints
- Enhanced scrollbar styling for better visibility

## Testing
1. **Test Page**: Created `/static/column-scroll-test.html` for debugging
2. **Debug CSS**: Added visual outlines to see column boundaries
3. **Console Logging**: Enhanced debug information showing positioning details

## Expected Results
- Scroll bars should now appear within their respective column boundaries
- No more "floating" scroll bars outside columns
- Consistent scroll behavior across all columns with > 4 tasks
- Proper containment without affecting adjacent columns

## Verification Steps
1. Open the test page and check debug outlines
2. Add tasks to columns to trigger scrolling
3. Verify scroll bars appear within blue outlines (column task areas)
4. Check that scroll functionality works properly
5. Ensure no scroll bars appear outside red outlines (column boundaries)

The fix focuses on proper CSS containment and simplified styling to ensure scroll bars are rendered within their intended column boundaries.
