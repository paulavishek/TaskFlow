# Real-Time Communication Features - Now Visible! ✅

## What Was Fixed

The real-time communication features were **fully implemented but hidden** from the application interface. Here's what was done:

### 1. **Missing Templates Created**
   - Created `/templates/messaging/` directory with all required templates:
     - `chat_room_list.html` - View all chat rooms for a board
     - `chat_room_detail.html` - Real-time chat interface
     - `create_chat_room.html` - Create new chat rooms
     - `task_thread_comments.html` - Task discussion comments
     - `notifications.html` - User notification center

### 2. **Navigation Added to Main Interface**
   - Added **Messages** link in the top navigation bar
   - Accessible from any page when logged in
   - Links to the notifications/messaging center

### 3. **Features Now Available**

#### 🎯 Chat Rooms (Board-Level Discussion)
- **Access**: Click "Messages" in navbar → Select a board → View chat rooms
- **URL**: `/messaging/board/<board_id>/rooms/`
- **Features**:
  - Create multiple chat rooms per board
  - Real-time WebSocket messaging
  - @mention support with notifications
  - Typing indicators
  - Message history pagination

#### 💬 Task Thread Comments
- **Access**: Open any task and click "Comments" section
- **URL**: `/messaging/task/<task_id>/comments/`
- **Features**:
  - Add comments directly on tasks
  - Real-time updates to all board members
  - @mention support for team members

### 4. **Architecture Components**

#### Backend Services Required
- **Daphne Server** (WebSocket handler) - Already running on port 8000
- **Redis** (Message broker) - For real-time communication
- **Celery** (Task processor) - For background tasks
- **Django Channels** - WebSocket support

#### Database Models
- `ChatRoom` - Board-level discussion channels
- `ChatMessage` - Individual messages in rooms
- `TaskThreadComment` - Comments on tasks
- `Notification` - User notifications
- `UserTypingStatus` - Real-time typing indicators

#### WebSocket Endpoints
- `ws://localhost:8000/ws/chat-room/<room_id>/` - Chat room messaging
- `ws://localhost:8000/ws/task-comments/<task_id>/` - Task comments

## How to Use

```batch
cd C:\Users\Avishek Paul\TaskFlow
start_taskflow.bat
```

This starts:
- Redis Server

- Mentioned users get instant notifications
- Messages appear in real-time to all members

### 4. **Task Comments**
1. Open any task on a board
2. Scroll to the "Comments" section
3. Type your comment
4. Use `@username` to mention teammates
5. Click "Post Comment"
6. Your comment appears instantly to all board members

### 5. **Checking Notifications**
1. Click "Messages" in the top navigation bar
2. View all your notifications
3. Unread notifications are highlighted
4. Click on a notification to view the related message or comment
5. Mark as read automatically when viewed

## Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Connection Issues
- Ensure Daphne server is running (port 8000)
- Check browser console for connection errors
- Verify Redis is running
- Check firewall settings

### Notifications Not Appearing
- Ensure Celery worker is running
- Check Redis connection
- Verify user email is set in profile (for email notifications)

### Messages Not Sending
- Verify you're a member of the chat room
- Check WebSocket connection status
- Try the HTTP fallback: Page refresh to see new messages

## Next Steps

1. **Test Real-Time Features**
   - Open multiple browser windows to same board
   - Send messages and see instant updates
   - @mention other users and check notifications

2. **Configure Notifications**
   - Go to user profile settings
   - Set up email notifications (optional)
   - Customize notification preferences

3. **Use in Team Collaboration**
   - Create chat rooms for different topics
   - Use task comments for discussions on specific tasks
   - Use @mentions to draw attention
   - Monitor notifications hub

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the Daphne/Celery/Redis logs in separate terminal windows
2. Verify all services are running (check start_taskflow.bat output)
3. Clear browser cache and refresh
4. Restart all services with stop_taskflow.bat then start_taskflow.bat
