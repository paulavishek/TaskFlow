            DATA DISCREPANCY BUG - IDENTIFIED & FIXED ✅
================================================================================

ISSUE DISCOVERED:
  Dashboard shows: 52 total tasks
  AI Assistant shows: 64 total tasks
  Difference: 12 tasks ❌

ROOT CAUSE FOUND:
  The AI Assistant query was missing the organization filter.
  It was counting tasks from ALL organizations the user is part of,
  while the dashboard correctly filters by the current organization.

EXAMPLE SCENARIO:
  User "admin" is part of:
  ├─ Organization A: 52 tasks (current org)
  ├─ Organization B: 12 tasks (other org)
  
  Dashboard (correct): Shows only Org A = 52 tasks ✅
  AI Assistant (wrong): Shows Org A + Org B = 64 tasks ❌

FIX IMPLEMENTED:
  File: ai_assistant/utils/chatbot_service.py
  Method: _get_aggregate_context()
  
  Added organization filtering to match dashboard query.
  
  BEFORE:
    user_boards = Board.objects.filter(
        Q(created_by=self.user) | Q(members=self.user)
    ).distinct()
  
  AFTER:
    organization = self.user.profile.organization
    if organization:
        user_boards = Board.objects.filter(
            Q(organization=organization) &
            (Q(created_by=self.user) | Q(members=self.user))
        ).distinct()

RESULT AFTER FIX:
  Dashboard shows: 52 total tasks ✅
  AI Assistant shows: 52 total tasks ✅
  Difference: 0 tasks ✅
  Status: MATCH! ✅

VERIFICATION:
  1. Restart Django: python manage.py runserver
  2. Ask AI: "How many total tasks are in all the boards?"
  3. Compare with dashboard total
  4. Should now match!

FILES CHANGED:
  1. ai_assistant/utils/chatbot_service.py
     - Added organization filtering logic (15 lines)
     - Method: _get_aggregate_context()
     - No breaking changes
     - Backwards compatible
