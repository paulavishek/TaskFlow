# Stakeholder Engagement Tracking Integration Guide

## Overview

This document describes the integration of **Stakeholder Engagement Tracking** features into TaskFlow, adapted from the Stakeholder Management project. The integration provides simple yet powerful stakeholder tagging, involvement tracking, and engagement metrics.

## Features

### 1. **Project Stakeholders** (Simple Tagging)
- Add stakeholders to projects (Boards)
- Track stakeholder information (name, role, organization, contact details)
- Analyze stakeholders using Power/Interest matrix (influence + interest levels)
- Set current and desired engagement levels
- Categorize into quadrants: "Manage Closely", "Keep Satisfied", "Keep Informed", "Monitor"

### 2. **Stakeholder Involvement Tracking**
- Track each stakeholder's involvement in specific tasks
- Define involvement types: Owner, Contributor, Reviewer, Stakeholder, Beneficiary, Impacted
- Record satisfaction ratings for task outcomes
- Capture feedback and concerns from stakeholders
- Track engagement frequency and timestamps

### 3. **Engagement Records**
- Log detailed engagement activities (meetings, emails, phone calls, presentations, surveys)
- Track communication channels and engagement outcomes
- Record stakeholder sentiment and satisfaction ratings
- Manage follow-ups and track completion
- Maintain complete audit trail of all stakeholder interactions

### 4. **Engagement Metrics Dashboard**
- View quadrant distribution (Power/Interest matrix visualization)
- Monitor engagement level distribution across stakeholders
- Track engagement frequency and average satisfaction ratings
- Identify stakeholders with engagement gaps
- Generate recommendations for increasing engagement

## Utility Functions

### `calculate_engagement_metrics(board)`
Calculates metrics for all stakeholders in a board over the last 30 days. Can be called periodically (e.g., daily via management command or Celery task).

### `update_stakeholder_engagement(stakeholder, task=None)`
Updates stakeholder engagement status based on recent activities.

### `get_stakeholder_summary(board)`
Returns summary statistics including total stakeholders, engagement counts, quadrant distribution, and average satisfaction.

### `identify_at_risk_stakeholders(board, days=30)`
Identifies stakeholders who haven't been engaged recently and may need attention.

### `get_engagement_recommendations(stakeholder)`
Generates recommendations for improving engagement with a specific stakeholder based on their profile and history.

## Engagement Strategy Levels

The integration uses a 5-level engagement strategy framework:

1. **Inform** - Provide information to help stakeholders understand issues and decisions
2. **Consult** - Obtain feedback and input from stakeholders
3. **Involve** - Work with stakeholders to ensure their concerns are understood
4. **Collaborate** - Partner with stakeholders in decision-making process
5. **Empower** - Place decision-making authority in stakeholders' hands

## Power/Interest Matrix

Stakeholders are categorized into four quadrants based on influence and interest levels:

| Quadrant | Influence | Interest | Strategy |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Manage Closely | High | High | Active engagement and collaboration |
| Keep Satisfied | High | Low | Keep satisfied with periodic updates |
| Keep Informed | Low | High | Keep informed and involved |
| Monitor | Low | Low | Monitor with minimal effort |

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate kanban
```

This creates all stakeholder-related tables.

### 2. Update URLs
The `kanban_board/urls.py` has been updated to include stakeholder URLs:
```python
path('stakeholder/', include('kanban.stakeholder_urls')),
```

### 3. Calculate Initial Metrics
```bash
python manage.py calculate_stakeholder_metrics
```

This command calculates engagement metrics for all boards.

- Stakeholder engagement status can inform risk assessments
- Communication of risks to stakeholders can be logged

### With Resource Management
- Stakeholder involvement can inform resource allocation
- Engagement status affects project communication needs

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Log engagement activities within 24 hours while fresh
2. **Satisfaction Tracking**: Always rate satisfaction after stakeholder interactions
3. **Follow-ups**: Set follow-up dates and ensure they're completed
4. **Gap Management**: Proactively increase engagement for stakeholders with gaps
5. **Documentation**: Use notes field to capture important context
6. **Quadrant Review**: Periodically review and update stakeholder quadrant positions
7. **Channel Preference**: Note preferred communication channels for each stakeholder
8. **Sentiment Tracking**: Monitor sentiment trends to catch issues early

## Troubleshooting

### Stakeholders Not Appearing
- Ensure stakeholder `is_active` is True
- Check board membership for current user
- Verify stakeholder is assigned to correct board

### Metrics Not Calculating
- Run `python manage.py calculate_stakeholder_metrics --board_id=<board_id>`
- Check for database errors in Django logs
- Ensure EngagementMetrics records are being created

### Engagement Records Not Linking to Tasks
- Ensure task exists in correct board
- Task should be optional (nullable) for general engagement records
- Unrelated engagement activities don't require task linkage

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions to the stakeholder management system:

1. **Automated Engagement Reminders**: Notify project managers when stakeholder engagement is overdue
2. **Communication Templates**: Pre-built templates for different engagement types
3. **Stakeholder Segments**: Group similar stakeholders for batch communications
4. **Engagement Timeline View**: Calendar view of planned and logged engagements
5. **Stakeholder Health Scores**: Automated calculation of engagement health
6. **Export Reports**: Generate PDF/Excel reports of stakeholder engagement
7. **Historical Analysis**: Track how stakeholder sentiment changes over project lifecycle
8. **Integration with Email**: Log email communications automatically
9. **Mobile App**: Record engagement on-the-go
10. **Notifications**: Alert team when stakeholder sentiment becomes negative
