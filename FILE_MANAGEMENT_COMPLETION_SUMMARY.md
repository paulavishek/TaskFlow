## Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
- ✅ Indexed on (chat_room, uploaded_at)
- ✅ Indexed on (task, uploaded_at)
- ✅ Indexed on (uploaded_by, uploaded_at)
- ✅ Soft deletes use filter(deleted_at__isnull=True)

### Storage Optimization
- ✅ Date-based directory organization
- ✅ 10MB file size limit prevents bloat
- ✅ Soft delete prevents data loss
- ✅ Files served from media directory

### Query Optimization
- ✅ File lists use values() for minimal queries
- ✅ Download doesn't load full objects
- ✅ Delete only updates soft_delete timestamp
- ✅ No N+1 query issues
