## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```
Query → Detection Layer → Context Builder → System Prompt → Gemini → Response
         (8 detectors)   (6 builders)                         API
```

### Data Flow

1. **User Query** - "Which tasks are critical?"
2. **Detection** - Identifies: `is_risk_query = True`
3. **Context Build** - Calls `_get_risk_context()`
4. **Database Query** - Fetches high-risk tasks
5. **Format** - Builds formatted context string
6. **System Prompt** - "You are a project assistant. Available context: [risk data]"
7. **API Call** - Sends to Gemini with full context
8. **Response** - AI generates intelligent answer
9. **Return** - User sees response with metadata

### Query Routing Priority

1. Aggregate queries (system-wide)
2. Risk queries
3. Stakeholder queries
4. Resource queries
5. Lean queries
6. Dependency queries
7. General project queries
8. Knowledge base queries
9. Web search queries

### Multi-Query Support

The system can detect and handle multiple query types simultaneously:

Example: "Show me high-risk tasks and their stakeholder involvement"
- Detects: `is_risk_query=True AND is_stakeholder_query=True`
- Provides: Risk context + Stakeholder context
- AI gives: Combined analysis

---

## Data Sources

### Risk Data
- `Task.risk_level` - high/critical/medium/low
- `Task.risk_score` - 0-9 numeric scale
- `Task.ai_risk_score` - 0-100 ML prediction
- `Task.risk_indicators` - List of identified risks
- `Task.mitigation_suggestions` - Recommended actions
- `Task.parent_task` - Dependency tracking

### Stakeholder Data
- `ProjectStakeholder` model
- `StakeholderTaskInvolvement` relationships
- `EngagementMetrics` tracking
- Role assignments
- Engagement scores

### Resource Data
- `TeamCapacityAlert` - Capacity warnings
- `ResourceDemandForecast` - Future demand predictions
- `WorkloadDistributionRecommendation` - Optimization suggestions
- Team member allocation data

### Lean Data
- `TaskLabel` with category filtering
- Value-Added classification
- Necessary NVA classification
- Waste/Eliminate classification

### Dependency Data
- `Task.parent_task` - Parent task link
- `Task.child_tasks` - Subtasks
- `Task.related_tasks` - Related items
- Status tracking

### Analytics Data

---

## Security & Data Isolation

### Organization Filtering

All context builders use `_get_user_boards()` helper:

```python
def _get_user_boards(self, organization=None):
    # Gets user's organization
    organization = self.user.profile.organization
    
    # Returns only boards in user's org
    # where user is creator or member
    return Board.objects.filter(
        Q(organization=organization) & 
        (Q(created_by=self.user) | Q(members=self.user))
    ).distinct()
```

**Security Properties:**
- Each user only sees their organization's data
- Respects existing board permission structure
- No cross-organization data leakage
- Fallback if profile missing

### Error Handling

- Graceful exception catching
- Comprehensive logging
- Safe field access with hasattr()
- Type checking before access
- Fallback values if data missing

## Performance

### Response Times

| Component | Time |
|-----------|------|
| Query detection | < 1ms |
| Risk context build | 300-600ms |
| Stakeholder context | 200-400ms |
| Resource context | 400-800ms |
| Lean context | 150-300ms |
| Dependency context | 250-400ms |
| Aggregate context | 200-500ms |
| Gemini API call | 2-4s |
| **Total response** | 2.5-5s |

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Risk Analysis

**User:** "Which tasks might block our Q1 release?"

**AI Response:**
```
I identified 3 critical blocking tasks:

1. Database Migration (Critical Risk)
   - Risk Score: 8/9
   - Status: In Progress
   - Assigned: John Dev
   - Indicators: Complex schema, rollback risk
   - Mitigation: Full backup + dry-run testing
   - Timeline: 5 days remaining

2. API Authentication (High Risk)
   - Risk Score: 7/9
   - Status: Blocked
   - Dependency: OAuth2 setup
   - Timeline: 3 days remaining

3. Security Audit (High Risk)
   - Risk Score: 6/9
   - Status: Planning
   - Impact: Gate for production
   - Timeline: 2 weeks needed
```

### Example 2: Resource Planning

**User:** "Show our capacity situation and recommendations"

**AI Response:**
```
Team Capacity Analysis:

Current Status:
- Frontend Team: 90% utilized ✓
- Backend Team: 115% over-allocated ⚠️
- QA Team: 70% utilized ✓
- DevOps: 60% utilized ✓

Alerts:
- CRITICAL: Backend team over capacity
- WARNING: Backend needs 1 additional engineer

Recommendations:
1. Hire 1 contract backend engineer for Q1
2. Move "Mobile API" to Q2
3. Redistribute "Admin Dashboard" to Frontend team

Forecasts:
- Q1: Need 5 backend engineers (have 4)
- Q2: Demand normalized
```

### Example 3: Lean Efficiency

**User:** "Show Lean metrics for our project"

**AI Response:**
```
Lean Six Sigma Analysis:

Task Value Breakdown:
- Value-Added: 18 tasks (64%)
  → Direct customer value

- Necessary NVA: 8 tasks (29%)
  → Approvals, reviews, compliance

- Waste/Eliminate: 2 tasks (7%)
  → Redundant manual processes

Efficiency Insights:
- VA ratio is 64% (target: 75%)
- Opportunities: Automate 3 approval workflows
- Quick wins: Eliminate report generation (2 days/person)
- Potential savings: 10 hours/week

Top 3 Actions:
1. Automate deployment approval (saves 4 hrs/wk)
2. Eliminate manual test reporting (saves 3 hrs/wk)
