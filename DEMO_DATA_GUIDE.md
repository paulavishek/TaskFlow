# TaskFlow Demo Data Guide

## Overview

The updated demo data script (`kanban/management/commands/populate_test_data.py`) now includes comprehensive sample data for all advanced features in TaskFlow including risk management, resource management, stakeholder engagement, and requirements management.

## Running the Demo Data Setup

### Reset and Repopulate Database

If you want to start fresh with demo data:

```bash
# Remove existing database (optional, only if you want a clean slate)
rm db.sqlite3

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Populate with demo data
python manage.py populate_test_data
```

### Add to Existing Database

If you already have a database and want to add more demo data:

```bash
python manage.py populate_test_data
```

The script is idempotent and won't duplicate existing data.

## Demo Data Features

### 1. 🛡️ Risk Management

The demo data includes risk assessments on approximately 70% of tasks with:

- **Risk Likelihood**: Low (1), Medium (2), High (3)

## Troubleshooting

### Demo Data Not Created

**Problem**: Script runs but doesn't create new feature data

**Solution**:
1. Verify migrations are applied: `python manage.py migrate`
2. Check model imports in the script
3. Ensure all models are properly installed
4. Run: `python manage.py shell` to test model imports

### Duplicate Data

**Problem**: Running script multiple times creates duplicates

**Solution**: The script uses `get_or_create()` to avoid duplicates. If issues persist:
1. Clear specific models: `python manage.py shell`
   ```python
   from kanban.models import ResourceDemandForecast
   ResourceDemandForecast.objects.all().delete()
   ```
2. Re-run: `python manage.py populate_test_data`

### Missing Stakeholder Features

**Problem**: Stakeholder data not appearing in UI

**Solution**:
1. Verify stakeholder models are installed
2. Check that migrations include stakeholder_models
3. Ensure stakeholder views are properly integrated

## Next Steps

1. **Explore the UI**: Navigate through boards to see demo data
2. **Test Features**: Use demo tasks to test risk, resource, and stakeholder features
3. **Review Docs**: Check specific feature guides (RISK_MANAGEMENT_INTEGRATION.md, etc.)
4. **Customize**: Modify demo data script for your specific use cases
5. **Deploy**: Once satisfied with features, prepare for production deployment
