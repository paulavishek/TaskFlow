## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STATUS

**‚úÖ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

The TaskFlow application has passed all deployment checks and is ready for Google Cloud App Engine deployment.

## üìã PRE-DEPLOYMENT FINAL STEPS

Before deploying, ensure:

1. **Replace placeholder values in app.yaml**:
   - Update `your-app-id.appspot.com` with your actual App Engine app ID
   - Consider using Google Secret Manager for SECRET_KEY in production

2. **Database Considerations**:
   - SQLite is currently configured (fine for demo/small scale)
   - For production scale, consider Cloud SQL PostgreSQL
   - Database file will be reset on each deployment with current setup

3. **Domain Configuration**:
   - Update ALLOWED_HOSTS in app.yaml with your actual domain
   - Configure custom domain in App Engine if needed

## üîß DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS

```bash
# Ensure you're in the project directory
cd "c:\Users\Avishek Paul\TaskFlow"

# Deploy to App Engine
gcloud app deploy

gcloud app deploy --project=your-project-id

# View deployment logs
gcloud app logs tail -s default
```
