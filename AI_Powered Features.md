### 1. AI Task Assistant: Smart Task Creation & Breakdown

This feature would help users create more detailed and actionable tasks from a simple idea.

* **What it does:** When a user creates a new task, they can input a high-level goal. An AI assistant can then automatically suggest a detailed description and break the goal down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks or a checklist.
* **Example in Action:**
    * **User Input Title:** `Launch new Q3 marketing campaign`
    * **AI Generated Description/Checklist (in the task description field):**
        ```
        **Objective:** Successfully launch the Q3 marketing campaign to increase user engagement.

        **Checklist:**
        - [ ] Draft campaign brief and define key metrics.
        - [ ] Finalize budget and resource allocation.
        - [ ] Create social media content calendar.
        - [ ] Design visual assets (images, videos).
        - [ ] Write and schedule email announcements.
        - [ ] Monitor campaign performance and report on key metrics.
        ```
* **How it works:** We would add a button like "Generate with AI" next to the description field in our `create_task.html` template. When clicked, we send the task title in a prompt to the Gemini API and ask it to generate a detailed description and a checklist.

### 2. AI-Powered Summaries

This feature saves users time by digesting long threads of information into concise summaries.

* **What it does:** For any task with a long history, a user can generate a summary of all comments or the entire activity log.
* **Example in Action:**
    * **On a task with 20+ comments:** Clicking "Summarize Comments" could produce: *"The main discussion points were about the API endpoint performance. A decision was made to add caching, and Michael is assigned to implement it. The deadline was updated to June 12th."*
* **How it works:** In the `task_detail.html` view, we'd add a "Summarize" button. This would collect the text from all comments or activity log entries, send it to the Gemini API with a prompt to summarize, and display the result.

### 3. Natural Language Analytics & Risk Identification

This enhances your existing analytics dashboard by adding a layer of automated interpretation.

* **What it does:** The AI analyzes the data from your `board_analytics` page and provides human-readable insights and flags potential risks.
* **Example in Action:**
    * Instead of just showing charts, an AI-generated text box could state: *"Your Value-Added percentage is strong at 80%. However, there are 5 high-priority tasks with overdue due dates that are still in the 'To Do' column. This presents a risk to the project timeline."*
* **How it works:** In our `board_analytics` view, we would gather the numerical data you already calculate (task counts, productivity scores, overdue tasks, etc.), format it into a text-based prompt for the Gemini API, and ask it to generate insights and identify risks.

### 4. AI-Suggested Lean Six Sigma (LSS) Classification

This feature directly improves your unique LSS functionality and helps users who may not be experts.

* **What it does:** When creating a task, the AI can suggest whether the task is likely to be Value-Added (VA), Necessary Non-Value-Added (NNVA), or Waste, based on its title and description.
* **Example in Action:**
    * **User Input Title:** `Fix critical login bug`
    * **AI Suggestion:** `This activity is likely **Waste** (rework due to a defect). Consider applying the 'Waste/Eliminate' label.`
    * **User Input Title:** `Develop new user profile page`
    * **AI Suggestion:** `This activity appears to be **Value-Added** as it directly provides new functionality to the customer.`
* **How it works:** This could be another AI-powered suggestion in the task creation or editing form. We would send the task details to the Gemini API and ask it to classify the activity according to LSS principles, with a brief justification. The user can then accept or override the suggestion.

These features are all achievable using API calls to a model like Gemini 1.5 Flash.
