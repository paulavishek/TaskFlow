# Data Discrepancy Quick Reference

## The Problem

| Component | Count | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Dashboard Total | 52 | ✅ |
| AI Assistant Total | 64 | ❌ |
| **Discrepancy** | **12** | **❌** |

---

## Why It Happened

The AI was counting tasks from multiple organizations:

```
Organization A: 52 tasks ← Current org (shown in dashboard)
Organization B: 12 tasks ← Other org (incorrectly included by AI)
─────────────────────────────
AI Total: 64 tasks ❌
Dashboard Total: 52 tasks ✅
```

---

## What Was Fixed

**File:** `ai_assistant/utils/chatbot_service.py`

**Method:** `_get_aggregate_context()`

**Change:** Added organization filter to match dashboard query

```python
# Before: No organization filter
# After: Filters by user's current organization
```

## After The Fix

| Component | Count | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Dashboard Total | 52 | ✅ |
| AI Assistant Total | 52 | ✅ |
| **Match** | **YES** | **✅** |

---

## How to Verify

1. **Start server:**
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Go to chat:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/assistant/chat/
   ```

3. **Ask AI:**
   ```
   "How many total tasks are in all the boards?"
   ```

4. **Expected response:**
   ```
   AI: "You have **52 total tasks**..."
   Dashboard: "52 total tasks"
   ✅ MATCH!
   ```

## Technical Details

### Dashboard Query (Correct)
```python
boards = Board.objects.filter(
    Q(organization=organization) &        # ✅ Org filter
    (Q(created_by=user) | Q(members=user))
)
```

### AI Query Before Fix (Wrong)
```python
user_boards = Board.objects.filter(
    Q(created_by=user) | Q(members=user)  # ❌ NO ORG FILTER
)
```

### AI Query After Fix (Correct)
```python
organization = user.profile.organization
if organization:
    user_boards = Board.objects.filter(
        Q(organization=organization) &    # ✅ ORG FILTER ADDED
        (Q(created_by=user) | Q(members=user))
    )
```

## Impact

- ✅ **Fixed:** AI aggregate queries now correct
- ✅ **No breaking changes:** All other queries unaffected
- ✅ **Data consistency:** Dashboard and AI now match
- ✅ **Organization isolation:** Each org only sees their tasks
