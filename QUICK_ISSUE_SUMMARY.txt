                    AI ASSISTANT FIX - QUICK SUMMARY
================================================================================

ISSUE REPORTED:
  User asked: "How many total tasks are in all the boards?"
  Result: AI said it could only see board names, not task data

ROOT CAUSE:
  The AI Assistant only provided full context for single-board queries.
  For all-boards queries, it only provided board names (no task counts).

WHAT WAS FIXED:
  File: ai_assistant/utils/chatbot_service.py
  
  Added:
    - _is_aggregate_query() method - detects system-wide queries
    - _get_aggregate_context() method - fetches total/status/board data
    - Enhanced get_response() - uses aggregate context when needed

RESULT:
  âœ… AI can now answer: "How many total tasks?"
  âœ… Shows: Total count, by status, by board
  âœ… No breaking changes
  âœ… Single-board queries still work

HOW TO TEST:
  1. Restart: python manage.py runserver
  2. Go to: http://localhost:8000/assistant/chat/
  3. Ask: "How many total tasks are in all the boards?"
  4. Should get: Complete statistics with counts

FILES CHANGED:
  1 file: ai_assistant/utils/chatbot_service.py
  ~80 lines added
  No database migrations
  No dependency changes

DEPLOYMENT:
  âœ… Safe to deploy immediately
  âœ… No data migration needed
  âœ… No configuration changes needed
