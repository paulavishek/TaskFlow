# RAG Integration - Quick Setup Summary

## Current Status

âœ… **RAG is already fully integrated in your code!**

Your chatbot has three retrieval sources:
1. **Project Data** - Tasks, team, boards from TaskFlow
2. **Knowledge Base** - Documented insights
3. **Web Search** - Latest information via Google Custom Search (needs API key)

---

## What You Need to Do

### Get 2 Keys from Google

**Key 1: Google Search API Key**
- Go: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
- Create API Key
- Copy it

**Key 2: Custom Search Engine ID**
- Go: https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/
- Create new search engine
- Copy the "Search Engine ID" (cx value)

### Update Your `.env` File

Add these lines (already added as placeholders):

```env
GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_key_here
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your_cx_here
ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH=True
```

### Test It

Start server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Go to: http://localhost:8000/assistant/chat/

Try a web search query like:
```
"What are the latest project management trends?"
```

If it works, you'll see sources cited in the response!

## How It Works

**Query â†’ AI Detects Type â†’ Retrieves Context â†’ Generates Response**

```
"latest frameworks" 
  â†’ Detected as WEB query
    â†’ Google Search retrieves results
      â†’ Injected into Gemini prompt
        â†’ Response with sources
```

vs.

```
"What tasks are assigned to me?"
  â†’ Detected as PROJECT query
    â†’ Project data retrieved
      â†’ Injected into Gemini prompt
        â†’ Response with task info
```
