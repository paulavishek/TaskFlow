## üöÄ **Real-World Example Output**

The demo script shows how the AI analyzes your team:

```
üî• ANALYZING RESOURCE BOTTLENECKS
Risk Score: 8/10
Critical Bottlenecks Found: 3

‚Ä¢ OVERUTILIZATION: Sarah is assigned 76 hours of work over the next two weeks, 
  exceeding her 40-hour capacity significantly.
  Affected: sarah_backend
  Severity: high

‚Ä¢ SKILL_SHORTAGE: The "Security" skill is required for urgent tasks but no one 
  on the team has this skill listed as expertise.
  Affected: Multiple
  Severity: medium

üéØ OPTIMIZING TASK ASSIGNMENTS
Tasks Analyzed: 2
Assignments Changed: 2
Skill Match Improvement: 50%
Workload Balance Score: 7/10

‚Ä¢ 'Create User Dashboard' -> emma_frontend
  Skill Match: 90%
  Reasoning: Emma has expert-level React skills and advanced UI/UX design skills...

‚öñÔ∏è BALANCING TEAM WORKLOAD
Workload Health Score: 7/10
Imbalance Severity: MEDIUM

Overloaded Members: 1
‚Ä¢ sarah_backend: 140% utilization
  Recommended Reduction: 40 hours

Underutilized Members: 4
‚Ä¢ alex_database: 46% utilization
  Available Capacity: 19 hours
```

## üéØ **How It Answers Your Requirements**

### ‚úÖ **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**
- **Skills Matching**: Analyzes 5 skill levels (Beginner ‚Üí Expert) for optimal task assignment
- **Historical Performance**: Tracks completion times, quality scores, and accuracy
- **Current Workload**: Real-time capacity tracking across all projects
- **Working Patterns**: Peak productivity hours and collaboration effectiveness
- **Team Dynamics**: Collaboration scores and preferred working relationships

### ‚úÖ **Predictive Intelligence**
The AI generates human-like insights such as:
> *"Sarah is currently at 140% capacity. If we assign her the 'Payment API' task (estimated 32 hours), she'll be overallocated by Thursday. However, Mike has similar backend skills and is only at 60% capacity. Recommend reassigning to Mike to avoid project delay."*
