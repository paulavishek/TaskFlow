## Feature 1: Predictive Team Capacity Forecasting (2-3 Week Forecast)

### ‚úÖ Status: FULLY INTEGRATED

#### Implementation Details

**Backend Services:**
- **File:** `kanban/utils/forecasting_service.py`
- **Class:** `DemandForecastingService`
- **Key Method:** `generate_team_forecast(board, days_ahead=21)`

**Core Functionality:**
```python
- Forecast period: 21 days (3 weeks) - configurable via FORECAST_PERIOD_DAYS
- Calculates per-team-member:
  ‚Ä¢ Current workload (tasks in To Do, In Progress, In Review columns)
  ‚Ä¢ Available capacity (working hours calculation)
  ‚Ä¢ Predicted future workload (current + 20% trend buffer)
  ‚Ä¢ Confidence score (based on historical task data)
  
- Team-wide metrics:
  ‚Ä¢ Total capacity hours
  ‚Ä¢ Total predicted workload
  ‚Ä¢ Team utilization percentage
  ‚Ä¢ Period start/end dates
```

**Database Model:**
- **Model:** `ResourceDemandForecast` (kanban/models.py)

**Recommendation Logic:**
```
1. Identify overloaded team members (workload > available capacity)
2. For each overloaded member:
   a. Find low-priority tasks for deferral
   b. Find underutilized members with available capacity
   c. Identify compatible tasks for reassignment
3. Generate prioritized recommendations (priority 7-8)
4. Calculate expected capacity savings
```

**Database Model:**
- **Model:** `WorkloadDistributionRecommendation` (kanban/models.py)

  - `affected_tasks` / `affected_users` - ManyToMany references
  - `expected_capacity_savings_hours` - Decimal calculation
  - `confidence_score` - 0.0-1.0
  - `status` - pending, accepted, rejected, implemented
  - `implemented_at` - Timestamp when accepted

**API Endpoints:**
```
GET  /board/<board_id>/recommendations/
POST /board/<board_id>/recommendation/<rec_id>/
```

- ‚ùå Reject - Decline recommendation
- ‚öôÔ∏è Implement - Execute the recommendation
  - Reassign tasks to suggested users
  - Move tasks to next column (deferral)
  - Update task status

**Frontend Templates:**
- **File:** `templates/kanban/workload_recommendations.html` (461 lines)
- Features:
  - Recommendations list with priority sorting
  - Filter bar (by type, status, impact)
  - Summary statistics (utilization, recommendations count)
  - Individual recommendation cards with:
    - Type badge (Reassign/Defer/etc)
    - Affected tasks list
    - Expected capacity savings
    - Confidence score indicator
    - Action buttons (Accept/Reject/Implement)

**AI-Powered Analysis:**

## Feature 3: Simple "Team Capacity Alert" System

### ‚úÖ Status: FULLY INTEGRATED

#### Implementation Details

**Alert System Design:**
- **Type:** Two-level alert system (Individual + Team-wide)
- **Alert Levels:** Warning (80-100% capacity), Critical (100%+ capacity)
- **Status Lifecycle:** Active ‚Üí Acknowledged ‚Üí Resolved

**Database Model:**
- **Model:** `TeamCapacityAlert` (kanban/models.py)
- **Key Fields:**
  - `alert_type` - 'individual' or 'team'
  - `alert_level` - 'warning' or 'critical'

  - `acknowledged_by` / `acknowledged_at` - Track acknowledgment
  - `resolved_at` - Track resolution

**Alert Generation Logic:**
```
Forecast Generation ‚Üí Team Capacity Analysis ‚Üí Alert Creation

For each team member:
  IF utilization >= 100%:
    Create CRITICAL alert: "{user} is critically overloaded (XXX% capacity)"
  ELSE IF utilization >= 80%:
    Create WARNING alert: "{user} is near capacity (XXX%)"

For entire team:
  IF team_utilization >= 100%:
    Create CRITICAL alert: "Team is critically overloaded (XXX% total)"
  ELSE IF team_utilization >= 80%:
    Create WARNING alert: "Team is near capacity (XXX% total)"
```

**Backend Services:**
- **Location:** `kanban/utils/forecasting_service.py`
- **Integration:** Automatically generated during `generate_team_forecast()`
- **Thresholds:**
  - `CAPACITY_WARNING_THRESHOLD = 0.80` (80%)

## Testing & Validation

### Recommended Testing Steps

1. **Feature 1: Forecasting**
   ```
   - Create board with team members
   - Create tasks and assign to members
   - Navigate to /board/<id>/forecast/
   - Click "Generate Forecast"
   - Verify forecasts display correctly
   - Check capacity calculations
   ```

2. **Feature 2: Recommendations**
   ```
   - With forecast generated
   - Navigate to /board/<id>/recommendations/
   - View generated recommendations
   - Test accept/reject/implement actions
   - Verify task reassignments work
   ```

3. **Feature 3: Alerts**
   ```
   - Create overloaded scenarios (>80% utilization)
   - Generate forecast
   - Verify alerts appear in both:
     - forecast_dashboard.html
     - capacity_alerts.html
   - Test acknowledge functionality
   - Test resolve functionality
   - Verify audit trail populated
   ```

### Database Queries to Verify

```python
# Check forecasts created
ResourceDemandForecast.objects.filter(board_id=<board_id>).count()

# Check recommendations generated
WorkloadDistributionRecommendation.objects.filter(board_id=<board_id>).count()

# Check active alerts
TeamCapacityAlert.objects.filter(board_id=<board_id>, status='active').count()

# Check capacity alerts by level
TeamCapacityAlert.objects.filter(board_id=<board_id>, alert_level='critical')
```

---

## Configuration & Customization

### Thresholds (in forecasting_service.py)
```python
FORECAST_PERIOD_DAYS = 21  # 3-week forecast
CAPACITY_WARNING_THRESHOLD = 0.80  # 80%
CAPACITY_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD = 1.00  # 100%
```

### Workload Calculation (in forecasting_service.py)
```python
# Base hours per task
base_hours = 8

# High-priority multiplier
high_priority_additional = 4 hours per task

# Priority multipliers for impact calculations
priority_multiplier = {
    'low': 1.0,
    'medium': 1.5,
    'high': 2.0,
    'urgent': 3.0,
}
```

### Confidence Scoring
```python
# Based on historical task count
< 5 tasks: 0.50 (low confidence)
5-15 tasks: 0.65 (medium confidence)
> 15 tasks: 0.85 (high confidence)
```

---

## Security & Access Control

All features implement:
- ‚úÖ Login required (@login_required decorator)
- ‚úÖ Board access verification (creator or member check)
- ‚úÖ Permission-based actions (only creator can resolve alerts)
- ‚úÖ CSRF protection on all POST requests
- ‚úÖ AJAX request verification (X-Requested-With header)

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Query Optimization:**
   - Uses `select_related()` for foreign keys
   - Uses `filter()` with appropriate `__in` lookups
   - Limits query results where appropriate

2. **Database Indexes:**
   - Consider adding indexes on:
     - `ResourceDemandForecast.board_id`
     - `TeamCapacityAlert.board_id`
     - `TeamCapacityAlert.status`
     - `WorkloadDistributionRecommendation.board_id`

3. **Caching Opportunities:**
   - Forecasts could be cached for 1 hour
   - Recommendations could be cached for 30 minutes
   - Alert summaries could be cached for 5 minutes

---

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. Workload calculation is based on task count (8 hours per task assumption)
   - Enhancement: Integrate actual time tracking
2. Confidence scoring is basic (based on task history count)
   - Enhancement: Use machine learning for better predictions
3. Trend multiplier is fixed at 1.2x
   - Enhancement: Calculate based on velocity trends

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Historical Analytics:** Track forecast accuracy over time
2. **Machine Learning:** Use past forecasts vs actuals for better predictions
3. **Resource Skills Matching:** Factor in skill requirements for recommendations
4. **Custom Thresholds:** Allow per-board customization of alert thresholds
5. **Notifications:** Email/Slack notifications for critical alerts
6. **Reporting:** Export forecast reports to PDF/CSV
7. **Team Capacity Planning:** Multi-week capacity planning view

---
