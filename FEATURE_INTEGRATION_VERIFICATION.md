#### Implementation Details

**Backend Services:**
- **File:** `kanban/utils/forecasting_service.py`
- **Class:** `DemandForecastingService`
- **Key Method:** `generate_team_forecast(board, days_ahead=21)`

**Core Functionality:**
```python
- Forecast period: 21 days (3 weeks) - configurable via FORECAST_PERIOD_DAYS
- Calculates per-team-member:
  • Current workload (tasks in To Do, In Progress, In Review columns)
  • Available capacity (working hours calculation)
  • Predicted future workload (current + 20% trend buffer)
  • Confidence score (based on historical task data)
  
- Team-wide metrics:
  • Total capacity hours
  • Total predicted workload
  • Team utilization percentage
  • Period start/end dates
```

**Recommendation Logic:**
```
1. Identify overloaded team members (workload > available capacity)
2. For each overloaded member:
   a. Find low-priority tasks for deferral
   b. Find underutilized members with available capacity
   c. Identify compatible tasks for reassignment
3. Generate prioritized recommendations (priority 7-8)
4. Calculate expected capacity savings
```

## Feature 3: Simple "Team Capacity Alert" System

### ✅ Status: FULLY INTEGRATED

#### Implementation Details

**Alert System Design:**
- **Type:** Two-level alert system (Individual + Team-wide)
- **Alert Levels:** Warning (80-100% capacity), Critical (100%+ capacity)
- **Status Lifecycle:** Active → Acknowledged → Resolved

**Database Model:**
- **Model:** `TeamCapacityAlert` (kanban/models.py)
- **Key Fields:**
  - `alert_type` - 'individual' or 'team'
  - `alert_level` - 'warning' or 'critical'
  - `status` - 'active', 'acknowledged', 'resolved'
  - `resource_user` - ForeignKey to overloaded user (null for team alerts)
  - `message` - Alert message with details
  - `workload_percentage` - Current utilization %
  - `acknowledged_by` / `acknowledged_at` - Track acknowledgment
  - `resolved_at` - Track resolution

**Alert Generation Logic:**
```
Forecast Generation → Team Capacity Analysis → Alert Creation

For each team member:
  IF utilization >= 100%:
    Create CRITICAL alert: "{user} is critically overloaded (XXX% capacity)"
  ELSE IF utilization >= 80%:
    Create WARNING alert: "{user} is near capacity (XXX%)"

For entire team:
  IF team_utilization >= 100%:
    Create CRITICAL alert: "Team is critically overloaded (XXX% total)"
  ELSE IF team_utilization >= 80%:
    Create WARNING alert: "Team is near capacity (XXX% total)"
```

**Backend Services:**
- **Location:** `kanban/utils/forecasting_service.py`
- **Integration:** Automatically generated during `generate_team_forecast()`
- **Thresholds:**
  - `CAPACITY_WARNING_THRESHOLD = 0.80` (80%)
  - `CAPACITY_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD = 1.00` (100%)

**API Endpoints:**
```
GET  /board/<board_id>/alerts/
POST /board/<board_id>/alerts/<alert_id>/acknowledge/

### Database Queries to Verify

```python
# Check forecasts created
ResourceDemandForecast.objects.filter(board_id=<board_id>).count()

# Check recommendations generated
WorkloadDistributionRecommendation.objects.filter(board_id=<board_id>).count()

# Check active alerts
TeamCapacityAlert.objects.filter(board_id=<board_id>, status='active').count()

# Check capacity alerts by level
TeamCapacityAlert.objects.filter(board_id=<board_id>, alert_level='critical')
```

---

## Configuration & Customization

### Thresholds (in forecasting_service.py)
```python
FORECAST_PERIOD_DAYS = 21  # 3-week forecast
CAPACITY_WARNING_THRESHOLD = 0.80  # 80%
CAPACITY_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD = 1.00  # 100%
```

### Workload Calculation (in forecasting_service.py)
```python
# Base hours per task
base_hours = 8

# High-priority multiplier
high_priority_additional = 4 hours per task

# Priority multipliers for impact calculations
priority_multiplier = {
    'low': 1.0,
    'medium': 1.5,
    'high': 2.0,
    'urgent': 3.0,
}
```

### Confidence Scoring
```python
# Based on historical task count
< 5 tasks: 0.50 (low confidence)
5-15 tasks: 0.65 (medium confidence)
> 15 tasks: 0.85 (high confidence)
```

## Security & Access Control

All features implement:
- ✅ Login required (@login_required decorator)
- ✅ Board access verification (creator or member check)
- ✅ Permission-based actions (only creator can resolve alerts)
- ✅ CSRF protection on all POST requests
- ✅ AJAX request verification (X-Requested-With header)

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Query Optimization:**
   - Uses `select_related()` for foreign keys
   - Uses `filter()` with appropriate `__in` lookups
   - Limits query results where appropriate

2. **Database Indexes:**
   - Consider adding indexes on:
     - `ResourceDemandForecast.board_id`
     - `TeamCapacityAlert.board_id`
     - `TeamCapacityAlert.status`
     - `WorkloadDistributionRecommendation.board_id`

3. **Caching Opportunities:**
   - Forecasts could be cached for 1 hour
   - Recommendations could be cached for 30 minutes
   - Alert summaries could be cached for 5 minutes

---

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. Workload calculation is based on task count (8 hours per task assumption)
   - Enhancement: Integrate actual time tracking
2. Confidence scoring is basic (based on task history count)
   - Enhancement: Use machine learning for better predictions
3. Trend multiplier is fixed at 1.2x
   - Enhancement: Calculate based on velocity trends

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Historical Analytics:** Track forecast accuracy over time
2. **Machine Learning:** Use past forecasts vs actuals for better predictions
3. **Resource Skills Matching:** Factor in skill requirements for recommendations
4. **Custom Thresholds:** Allow per-board customization of alert thresholds
5. **Notifications:** Email/Slack notifications for critical alerts
6. **Reporting:** Export forecast reports to PDF/CSV
7. **Team Capacity Planning:** Multi-week capacity planning view
