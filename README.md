## ❓ Troubleshooting

### 🔧 Common Issues and Solutions

#### AI Features Not Working

**Problem**: "Get AI Recommendations" button doesn't work or returns errors

**Solutions:**

1. **Check API Key**: Ensure your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is correctly set in `.env`
   ```bash
   python test_gemini_api.py  # Test your Gemini API connection
   ```
2. **Verify Internet Connection**: Gemini AI features require internet access
3. **Check API Quota**: Ensure you haven't exceeded Gemini API rate limits
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to reload JavaScript files

#### Google OAuth Issues
**Problem**: "Sign in with Google" not working
**Solutions:**
1. **Check Credentials**: Verify `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`
2. **Authorized Redirect URIs**: Ensure your domain is listed in Google Cloud Console
3. **API Enabled**: Confirm Google+ API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
4. **Test Script**: Run `python test_google_oauth.py` to validate setup

#### Database Errors
**Problem**: Database-related errors or missing tables
**Solutions:**
1. **Run Migrations**: `python manage.py migrate`
2. **Check Database**: Ensure `db.sqlite3` exists and has proper permissions
3. **Fresh Start**: Delete `db.sqlite3` and run `python manage.py migrate` again
4. **Create Superuser**: `python manage.py createsuperuser` for admin access

#### Static Files Not Loading
**Problem**: CSS/JavaScript files not loading properly
**Solutions:**
1. **Collect Static Files**: `python manage.py collectstatic --noinput`
2. **Check DEBUG Setting**: Ensure `DEBUG = True` in development
3. **File Permissions**: Verify static files directory has proper permissions
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh to reload cached files

#### Email Reset Not Working
**Problem**: Password reset emails not being sent
**Solutions:**
1. **SMTP Configuration**: Check email settings in `.env`:
   ```
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
   EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_app_password
   ```
2. **Gmail App Password**: Use App Password, not regular password
3. **Test Email**: Run Django shell test: `python manage.py shell`

#### Performance Issues
**Problem**: Slow loading or AI response times
**Solutions:**
1. **Check System Resources**: Ensure adequate RAM (2GB+ recommended)
2. **API Response Time**: Gemini API responses can take 2-10 seconds
3. **Database Optimization**: For large datasets, consider PostgreSQL
4. **Browser Performance**: Close unused tabs, try different browser

## 🤖 Gemini-Powered Features

TaskFlow leverages Google's advanced Gemini 1.5 Flash model to make project management smarter, faster, and more efficient:

### 🧠 How Our Gemini AI Works

Our intelligent features are not based on simple rules or templates. **TaskFlow uses Google's Gemini, a powerful large language model, to provide genuine creativity and analysis.** When you request a recommendation or summary, your project's context (like a board title or comment thread) is securely sent to the Gemini API. The model then generates insightful, human-like responses that understand your specific business context.

**🔒 Privacy & Security:**
- Your sensitive project data is processed securely through Google's enterprise-grade APIs
- No data is stored permanently by the AI model - each request is independent
- All AI processing respects your organization's access permissions
- You maintain full control over when and how AI features are used

**🎯 Why Gemini?**
- **Advanced Understanding**: Recognizes context, industry patterns, and best practices
- **Human-like Intelligence**: Provides thoughtful recommendations, not just automated responses  
- **Continuous Learning**: Benefits from Google's ongoing AI improvements
- **Proven Reliability**: Enterprise-grade infrastructure you can trust

This API-driven approach allows TaskFlow to leverage cutting-edge AI without requiring you to manage any training data or complex infrastructure.
