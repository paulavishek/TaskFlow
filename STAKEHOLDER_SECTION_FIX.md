# Stakeholder Management Section - Fix Summary

## Issue
The 👥 Stakeholder Management section was not displaying on the task detail page even though the template had the code for it.

## Root Cause
The `stakeholders` variable was not being passed from the view to the template. The template had the conditional check `{% if stakeholders %}` but the context dictionary was missing the `stakeholders` key.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `kanban/views.py` - task_detail function

**Added import at top of file (line 20):**
```python
from .stakeholder_models import StakeholderTaskInvolvement
```

**Updated context in task_detail view (lines 420-432):**
```python
# Get stakeholders involved in this task
stakeholders = StakeholderTaskInvolvement.objects.filter(task=task)

return render(request, 'kanban/task_detail.html', {
    'task': task,
    'board': board,
    'form': form,
    'comment_form': comment_form,
    'comments': comments,
    'activities': activities,
    'stakeholders': stakeholders,  # ← Added this line
})
```

## What Will Now Display

When you open a task detail page, if there are stakeholders involved with that task, you'll see:

**👥 Stakeholders Section showing:**
- Stakeholder name and role
- Involvement type (Owner, Contributor, Reviewer, Stakeholder)
- Engagement status (Informed, Consulted, Involved)
- Satisfaction rating (1-5 stars)

## Testing

To verify stakeholders appear:

1. Start Django server: `python manage.py runserver`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/kanban/board/`
3. Click any task
4. Scroll down the right sidebar
5. Look for the **👥 Stakeholders** section

**Sample tasks with stakeholders:**
- "Implement user authentication"
- "Login page not working on Safari"
- "Inconsistent data in reports"

## Technical Details

### Database Query
The view now queries `StakeholderTaskInvolvement` model for all records matching the current task:
```python
stakeholders = StakeholderTaskInvolvement.objects.filter(task=task)
```

### Template Rendering
The template loops through stakeholder involvement records:
```html
{% if stakeholders %}
  {% for involvement in stakeholders %}
    <!-- Display stakeholder info -->
  {% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```

### Related Models
- `StakeholderTaskInvolvement` - Links stakeholders to tasks
- `ProjectStakeholder` - Main stakeholder model with name, role, influence/interest levels

## Status
✅ Fixed - Stakeholders now display on task detail page
✅ Demo data includes 5 stakeholders with multiple task involvements
✅ No errors in views.py

## Files Modified
- `kanban/views.py` - Added import and updated task_detail view

## Next Steps
If you still don't see stakeholders on certain tasks:
1. Verify demo data was created: `python manage.py shell` → `from kanban.stakeholder_models import StakeholderTaskInvolvement` → `StakeholderTaskInvolvement.objects.count()`
2. Check specific task has stakeholders: Filter for task ID in StakeholderTaskInvolvement
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete) and reload page
