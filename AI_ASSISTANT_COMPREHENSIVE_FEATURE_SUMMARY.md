## Feature 1: Risk Management

**Ask the AI:**
- "Which tasks have the highest risk?"
- "What are the blockers?"
- "What problems might delay us?"

**The AI will show:**
- High-risk tasks with risk scores
- Risk indicators identified
- Mitigation suggestions
- Dependent tasks

---

## Feature 2: Stakeholder Management

**Ask the AI:**
- "Who are our stakeholders?"
- "What's the engagement status?"
- "Which team members are involved?"

**The AI will show:**
- Stakeholder list and roles
- Engagement levels and scores
- Task involvement counts
- Communication status

---

## Feature 3: Resource Management

**Ask the AI:**
- "What's our team capacity?"
- "Are we over-allocated?"
- "Show resource forecasts"

**The AI will show:**
- Team capacity alerts
- Demand forecasts
- Workload recommendations
- Utilization analysis

---

## Feature 4: Lean Six Sigma

**Ask the AI:**
- "Show waste analysis"
- "How much is value-added?"
- "What should we eliminate?"

**The AI will show:**
- Value-Added task % and count
- Necessary NVA task % and count
- Waste/Eliminate task % and count
- Efficiency recommendations

---

## Feature 5: Task Dependencies

**Ask the AI:**
- "What tasks are blocked?"
- "Show dependency chains"
- "What depends on payment module?"

**The AI will show:**
- Blocked tasks and their blockers
- Subtask relationships
- Critical dependency chains
- Related task mappings

---

## Feature 6: Aggregate Analytics

**Ask the AI:**
- "How many total tasks?"
- "Tasks across all boards?"
- "What's the overall status?"

**The AI will show:**
- Total task count
- Tasks by status
- Tasks by board
- Board distribution

---

## How It Works

1. **User asks question** → "Which tasks have high risk?"
2. **AI detects query type** → `is_risk_query = True`
3. **Fetches relevant data** → High-risk tasks from database
4. **Builds context** → Formats risk data for Gemini
5. **Adds system prompt** → "You are a project management AI..."
6. **Sends to Gemini** → AI generates intelligent response
7. **Returns answer** → "Your 3 high-risk tasks are..."

---

## Smart Query Routing

The AI intelligently detects multiple query types:

```
"Show me high-risk tasks and their stakeholders"
    ↓
Detects: is_risk_query=True AND is_stakeholder_query=True
    ↓
Provides: Risk context + Stakeholder context
    ↓
Gemini generates: Combined analysis
```

---

## Implementation Details

**File Modified:** `ai_assistant/utils/chatbot_service.py`

**Changes:**
- Added 8 query detectors (5-40 lines each)
- Added 6 context builders (35-60 lines each)
- Enhanced `get_response()` with intelligent routing
- Total: ~400 lines of new functionality

**Models Supported:**
- Task (core)
- ProjectStakeholder (optional)
- ResourceDemandForecast (optional)
- TeamCapacityAlert (optional)
- WorkloadDistributionRecommendation (optional)

**Graceful Degradation:**
- If models missing, feature disabled
- No errors if feature data unavailable
- Falls back to general project queries

---

## Data Security

✅ **Organization Isolation:** Each user only sees their organization's data
✅ **Board Access Control:** Only authorized board members' data shown
✅ **User Filtering:** Inherits existing permission structure

## Example Questions & Responses

### Question 1
**Input:** "What are our critical blockers?"
```
Response: "I found 3 critical blockers:
1. Database Migration (Risk: Critical, Score: 8/9)
   - Assigned to: John Dev
   - Mitigation: Implement backup strategy
   
2. Payment Integration (Risk: High, Score: 7/9)
   - Assigned to: Sarah Dev
   - Depends on: API Authentication
   - Mitigation: Parallelize API work
   
3. Infrastructure Setup (Risk: High, Score: 6/9)
   - Assigned to: DevOps Team
   - Mitigation: Pre-stage resources"
```

### Question 2
**Input:** "Show team capacity and stakeholder involvement"
```
Response: "Team Capacity Summary:
- John Dev: 120% allocated (ALERT)
- Sarah Dev: 85% utilized
- QA Team: 70% utilized

Top Stakeholders:
- CEO (Engagement: High, Tasks: 8)
- Product Manager (Engagement: High, Tasks: 12)
- Department Lead (Engagement: Medium, Tasks: 5)"
```

### Question 3
**Input:** "How much of our work is value-added?"
```
Response: "Lean Analysis:
- Value-Added: 18 tasks (64%)
  → Direct customer value
  
- Necessary NVA: 8 tasks (29%)
  → Process overhead but necessary
  
- Waste/Eliminate: 2 tasks (7%)
  → Should be removed

Recommendation: Focus on increasing 
value-added work percentage"
```
