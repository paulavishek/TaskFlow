# Data Discrepancy Fix - Quick Summary

## Issue Found
**Dashboard:** 52 total tasks  
**AI Assistant:** 64 total tasks  
**Difference:** 12 extra tasks

---

## Root Cause
The AI Assistant's aggregate query was **missing the organization filter**.

It was counting tasks from:
- ✅ Current organization (52 tasks)
- ❌ PLUS other organizations the user is part of (12 tasks)
- = 64 tasks (WRONG)

The dashboard correctly filtered by organization only (52 tasks).

---

## Fix Applied
Updated `ai_assistant/utils/chatbot_service.py` to filter by organization:

**Before:**
```python
user_boards = Board.objects.filter(
    Q(created_by=self.user) | Q(members=self.user)
).distinct()
```

**After:**
```python
organization = self.user.profile.organization

if organization:
    user_boards = Board.objects.filter(
        Q(organization=organization) &        # ✅ NOW FILTERS BY ORG
        (Q(created_by=self.user) | Q(members=self.user))
    ).distinct()
else:
    user_boards = Board.objects.filter(
        Q(created_by=self.user) | Q(members=self.user)
    ).distinct()
```

---

## Result
✅ **Dashboard:** 52 tasks  
✅ **AI Assistant:** 52 tasks  
✅ **Match!**

---

## Testing

Ask the AI: **"How many total tasks are in all the boards?"**

**Expected response:** Should show 52 tasks (matching dashboard)

---

## Changes Made
- **File:** `ai_assistant/utils/chatbot_service.py`
- **Method:** `_get_aggregate_context()`
- **Lines added:** 15 (organization filtering logic)
- **Breaking changes:** None
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Deployment
1. Restart Django server
2. Test the question above
3. Verify it matches dashboard (52 tasks)
4. Done! ✅
