🔧 AI-POWERED TIMELINE ANALYSIS FIX - SUMMARY
================================================

✅ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
The AI-Powered Timeline Analysis features were showing "[object Object]" because:

      - Handles structured recommendation objects with priority, effort, impact
      - Added timeline insights display with progress bars
      - Supports both object and string recommendations
      - Added professional card layouts with color coding

   B. Updated generateTimeline():
      - Properly handles timeline_phases, resource_timeline, critical_milestones
      - Shows meaningful messages when data is empty
      - Displays timeline insights with health indicators
      - Uses enhanced recommendation formatting

   C. Updated analyzeCriticalPath():
      - Added graceful error handling with helpful messages
      - Explains what's needed for critical path analysis
