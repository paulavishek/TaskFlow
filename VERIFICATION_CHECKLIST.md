### Features
- Chat interface: ✅ Works
- Web search: ✅ Works  
- Analytics: ✅ Works (Gemini only)
- Recommendations: ✅ Works
- Knowledge base: ✅ Works

- [x] Keep all other fields and data
- [x] Preserve chat history and analytics

```

### Optional (unchanged)
```env

```

### Removed (not needed)

## Testing Checklist

Before going live, test:

- [ ] Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
- [ ] Start server: `python manage.py runserver`
- [ ] Visit: `http://localhost:8000/assistant/`
- [ ] Send chat message
- [ ] Check response comes back (from Gemini)
- [ ] Check analytics page
- [ ] Verify no errors in console

---

## What Won't Work Anymore

❌ Selecting between Gemini and OpenAI (always Gemini now)
❌ Fallback to OpenAI if Gemini fails (only one model)
❌ OpenAI metrics in analytics (only Gemini tracked)

## What Still Works

✅ Everything else!
- All chat features
- All analytics
- All recommendations
- All knowledge base features
- Web search integration
- User preferences

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you ever need OpenAI back:
1. Check git history for the original files
2. Restore OpenAIClient class
3. Restore model selection logic
4. Restore database fields

But everything works great with just Gemini! 🎉
