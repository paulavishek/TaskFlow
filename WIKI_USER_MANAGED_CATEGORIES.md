# Wiki Categories - User-Managed Implementation

## Overview
Converted wiki categories from fixed/pre-created to fully user-managed. Users can now create, edit, and delete categories for their organization.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Added New Views (`wiki/views.py`)

Added two new views for category management:

#### WikiCategoryUpdateView
- Allows users to edit existing categories
- Filters categories by organization
- Shows success message on update
- Redirects to category list

#### WikiCategoryDeleteView
- Allows users to delete categories
- Shows confirmation page
- Warns if category has pages (pages become uncategorized but aren't deleted)
- Shows success message on deletion
- Redirects to category list

### 2. Updated URLs (`wiki/urls.py`)

Added new URL routes:
```python
path('categories/<int:pk>/edit/', views.WikiCategoryUpdateView.as_view(), name='category_edit'),
path('categories/<int:pk>/delete/', views.WikiCategoryDeleteView.as_view(), name='category_delete'),
```

### 3. Enhanced Templates

#### `category_form.html` - Redesigned
- Now handles both create and edit modes
- Added form field labels and help text
- Added color picker for category color
- Added icon name helper with visual reference
- Added position field for sorting
- Shows "Edit" or "Create" based on mode
- Includes sidebar with Font Awesome icon reference

#### `category_list.html` - Enhanced with Management
- Added Edit and Delete buttons that appear on hover
- Buttons only show when hovering over category card
- Edit button links to edit form
- Delete button links to confirmation page
- Still supports clicking category to view pages
- Better visual feedback with hover effects

#### `category_confirm_delete.html` - New Template
- Shows category name being deleted
- Warns about action being irreversible
- Shows number of pages in category (if any)
- Explains that pages become uncategorized
- Confirm and Cancel buttons

### 4. Removed Pre-Created Categories (`wiki/setup_wiki.py`)

Updated setup script to:
- No longer create fixed categories
- Inform users that they can create categories manually
- Provide instructions on how to access category management
- Simplified to just an informational script

## How Users Create Categories

### Step 3: Fill Category Details
- **Name**: Category title (required)
- **Description**: Optional description
- **Icon**: Font Awesome icon name (e.g., "folder", "book", "code")
- **Color**: Hex color code for visual distinction
- **Position**: Display order (lower numbers first)

### Step 4: Create or Edit
- Click "Create Category" (for new) or "Update Category" (for edit)
- Get success confirmation
- Redirect to category list

### Step 5: Manage Categories
- View all categories at `/wiki/categories/`
- Edit any category by clicking edit button
- Delete category by clicking delete button
- Click category name to view pages in it

## Feature Comparison

### Before (Fixed Categories)
```
❌ 7 hardcoded categories created for each organization
❌ Users couldn't add custom categories
❌ Setup script had to be run
❌ No management interface for categories
❌ All organizations had identical categories
```

### After (User-Managed Categories)
```
✅ Users create categories as needed
✅ Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
✅ No setup script required
✅ Intuitive management interface
✅ Each organization customizes their own categories
✅ Edit categories anytime
✅ Delete categories (with confirmation)
✅ Organize by position field
✅ Visual customization with colors and icons
```

## Data Model

### WikiCategory Fields Used
- `name`: Category title
- `slug`: Auto-generated URL-safe name (auto-slugified from name)
- `description`: Optional description
- `organization`: Foreign key to organization
- `icon`: Font Awesome icon name
- `color`: Hex color code
- `position`: Display order
- `created_at`: Auto-set on creation
- `updated_at`: Auto-updated on changes

### Uniqueness Constraints
- Per Organization: `(organization, name, slug)` must be unique
- Allows same category names in different organizations
